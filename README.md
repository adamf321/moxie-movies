# Moxie Movies WordPress Plugin

This plugin will create a Movies post type. You can add/edit movies from the WordPress dashboard by selecting the Movies options.

The plugin will override your site's front page with the full list of movies. they're loaded via AJAX after the page loads.

The plugin API caches the results. The cache is cleared whenever a movie post is published (but not when one is unpublished or edited).
